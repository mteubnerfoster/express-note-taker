# express-note-taker
I created a note taking application that allows users to enter and save notes.
This app runs in the user's browser.

## What to Expect
* When users open the Note Taker, they are presented with a landing page with a link to the Notes page
* When they click on the link to the notes page, they are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
* When users enter a new note title and the note’s text, a save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
* When users click the Save icon, the new note is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
* When users click an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, that note appears in the right-hand column
* When users click the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, they are presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
* When users click the Trash Can icon next to a saved note, the note is deleted from the list
